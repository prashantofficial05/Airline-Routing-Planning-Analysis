## Airline Routing Planning Analysis in SQL

Airline Routing Planning Analysis Introduction:  A comprehensive analysis of airline routing and flight planning to gain insights into airline operations, route efficiency, flight pricing trends, and customer demand patterns. This project uses fictional data to explore key aspects of airline route management and optimize route planning strategies.


  **Goal:**
  
   Evaluate and analyze airline routes, understand flight pricing, route demand, and seat availability, and 
   optimize route planning. Additionally, it analyzes key factors that impact flight scheduling, route efficiency, and 
   airline profitability.

**Description:**
   - **Define Scope:**  Focus on airline operations, route management, and flight data to explore and optimize 
         airline routing, pricing, and customer demand patterns.
   - **Data Collection:** Sample datasets simulate airport information, airlines, flight schedules, routes, and 
        passenger bookings, including ticket prices and seat availability.
   - **Data Analysis:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on flight schedules, route demand, flight prices, 
        and customer booking patterns. Identify the most popular routes and analyze the factors influencing 
        pricing and flight durations.
   - **Route Optimization:** Analyze flight durations, seat occupancy rates, and prices to recommend optimal 
        flight routes and schedules for maximizing profitability and customer satisfaction.
   - **Customer Demand:** Analyze customer booking patterns to identify peak travel times, popular destinations, 
        and the relationship between flight pricing and demand.
     
**Skills:**
   - **SQL** for database creation, querying, and analysis (includes advanced techniques like window functions, 
          joins, and aggregations).
   - **Data Analysis** techniques for understanding route demand, seat availability, and pricing trends.
   - **Python** for additional data cleaning, analysis, and flight route visualization.
   - **Data visualization** using tools like Tableau or Matplotlib to report key insights on route efficiency and 
          customer demand.
     
**Metrics:**
   - **Flight pricing trends** across different routes and seasons.
   - **Seat availability** and occupancy rates for each route.
   - **Flight durations** between different airport pairs.
   - **Customer demand** patterns, including peak travel times and popular destinations.
   - **Route profitability** analysis based on pricing, demand, and flight capacity.


**Summary:**

   This project provides valuable insights into airline routing, pricing strategies, customer booking patterns, 
   and flight scheduling. It helps airlines understand customer preferences, optimize flight routes, and improve 
   profitability through efficient route planning.

**Next Steps:**
   - Enhance the analysis by incorporating **dynamic pricing models** based on demand and seasonality.
   - Integrate **weather data** and other external factors to predict flight delays and optimize flight scheduling.
   - Expand customer analysis by including **frequent flyer programs** to identify high-value customers and adjust 
      route planning accordingly.
